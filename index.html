    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>
      I am a student at the Illinois Institute of Technology majoring in
      Computer Engineering and this is my fourth year at the institution. I was
      born and semi-raised in the city of Chicago. My first job was at a
      car-wash at the age of 13 and it was then when I knew that I wanted to
      work in the automotive industry.
    </p>
    <h2> Career at IIT and Beyond </h2>
    <p>
      I hope to one day be a software engineer in the automotive industry. At
      first I didn't like coding, but that was primarily due to the lack of
      practice. After putting in the work, I was able to become the
      web-developer for my robotics team and was also able to land an internship
      as an Embedded Software Engineer. I also am a part of the SHPE
      organization at IIT, which helps me improve my professional skills as well
      as mentor others.
    </p>
    <h2> Ambitions for This class </h2>
    <p>
      My hopes for this class are to improve my skills as a beginner
      web-developer. I have taught myself HTML and CSS. I feel this class will
      tailor my skills and show me how things are properly done in the industry
      as a web-developer. Web developing is one of the career paths that  I am
      looking to pursue with my degree, and I hope to learn a lot from this
      course.
