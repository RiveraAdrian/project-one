    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p class="blocktext">
      I am a student at the Illinois Institute of Technology
      majoring in Computer Engineering and this is my fourth
      year at the institution. I was born and semi-raised in
      the city of Chicago. My first job was at a car-wash at
      the age of 13 and it was then when I knew that I wanted
      to work in the automotive industry.
    </p>
    <h2> Career at IIT and Beyond </h2>
    <p class="blocktext">
      I hope to one day be a software engineer in the
      automotive industry. At first I didn't like coding,
      but that was primarily due to the lack of practice.
      After putting in the work, I was able to become the
      web-developer for my robotics team and was also able
      to land an internship as an Embedded Software Engineer.
      I also am a part of the SHPE organization at IIT, which
      helps me improve my professional skills as well as
      mentor others.
    </p>
    <h2> Ambitions for This class </h2>
    <p class="blocktext">
      My hopes for this class are to improve my skills as a
      beginner web-developer. I have taught myself
      HTML and CSS. I feel this class will tailor my skills
      and show me how things are properly done in the industry
      as a web-developer. Web developing is one of the career
      paths that  I am looking to pursue with my degree, and
      I hope to learn a lot from this course.
