I am a student at the Illinois Institute of Technology
majoring in Computer Engineering and this is my fourth
at the institution. I was born and semi-raised in the
city of Chicago. My first job was at a car-wash at the
age of 13 and it was then when I knew that I wanted to
work in the automotive industry.

I hope to one day be a software engineer in the
automotive industry. At first I didn't like coding,
but that was primarily due to the lack of practicing.
After putting in the work, I was able to become the
web-developer for my robotics team and was also able
to land an internship as an embedded software engineer.
